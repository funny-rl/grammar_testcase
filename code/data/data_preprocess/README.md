## Filtering Process

V1.
1.  **Filter 1198 labeled data points** by evaluating them against **30 test cases** (degree -1:1, 1:15, 2:14), using all available correct solutions.
2.  **Retain only data points** that yield **more than 10 correct solutions or same**.
3.  From the retained data, **remove all correct solutions except for the most frequently occurring output code**.
4.  Check all data that have match rate lower than 80% **need_check: 108**
We finally leaved **858 data**

v1.5 
1. Filtering the Wrong data (semantically + syntactically) In only need_check: True.
2. Filtered 54 data. 

V2.
1.  **Filter 805 labeled data points** by evaluating them against **30 test cases** (degree -1:1, 1:15, 2:14), using all available correct solutions.
2.  **Retain only data points** that yield **more than 10 correct solutions or same**.
3.  From the retained data, **remove all correct solutions except for the most frequently occurring output code**.
4.  Check all data that have match rate lower than 80% **need_check: 5**
We finally leaved **796 data**

v2.5 
1. Filtering the Wrong data (semantically + syntactically). In only need_check: True.
2. Filtered 1 data. 

V3.
1.  **Filter 795 labeled data points** by evaluating them against **30 test cases** (degree -1:1, 0:10, 1:10, 2:9), using all available correct solutions.
2.  **Retain only data points** that yield **more than 10 correct solutions or same**.
3.  From the retained data, **remove all correct solutions except for the most frequently occurring output code**.
4.  Check all data that have match rate lower than 80% **need_check: 4**
We finally leaved **784 data**

v3.5 
1. Filtering the Wrong data (semantically + syntactically). In only need_check: True.
2. Filtered 2 data. 

V4.
1.  **Filter 782 labeled data points** by evaluating them against **30 test cases** (degree -1:1, 0:10, 1:10, 2:9), using all available correct solutions.
2.  **Retain only data points** that yield **more than 10 correct solutions or same**.
3.  From the retained data, **remove all correct solutions except for the most frequently occurring output code**.
4.  Check all data that have match rate lower than 80% **need_check: 1**
We finally leaved **780 data**

v4.5 
1. Filtering the Wrong data (semantically + syntactically). In only need_check: True.
2. Filtered 0 data. 

V5.
1.  **Filter 780 labeled data points** by evaluating them against **30 test cases** (degree -1:1, 0:10, 1:10, 2:9), using all available correct solutions.
2.  **Retain only data points** that yield **more than 10 correct solutions or same**.
3.  From the retained data, **remove all correct solutions except for the most frequently occurring output code**.
4.  Check all data that have match rate lower than 80% **need_check: 0**
We finally leaved **778 data**
